# IaCs with Terraform
 Testing and learning Terraform Infrastructure As Code with AWS services

This is an incremental process of making things from the beginning.
Learn and Create!

#### Making aws infrastructures with Terraform:
* create s3 bucket  (tested)
* python file -> zip -> up to s3 -> create a lambda function (tested)
* AWS API Gateway Rest API ()

Next
* Make a fully functional API with backend

and so on....

The codes are tested by me. But I can not assure that they will run on your world/devices.

To run -
`terraform init`

`terraform plan`

`terraform apply`

If you wish to delete infrastructures after playing
`terraform destroy`
