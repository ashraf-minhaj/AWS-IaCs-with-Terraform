# IaCs with Terraform
 Testing and learning Terraform Infrastructure As Code with AWS services

This is an incremental process of making things from the beginning. Learn while making!

#### Making aws infrastructures with Terraform:
* create s3 bucket  (tested)
* python file -> zip -> up to s3 -> create a lambda function (tested)
* AWS API Gateway Rest API with Lambda (tested)
* (NEXT) __Project:__ BackBencher Replies API (API Gateway, Lambda, TF)
* (NEXT) EC2
* (NEXT) API Gatway -> SNS -> Lambda
* (NEXT) Fully functional Serverless Application 

and so on....

The codes are tested by me. But I can not assure that they will run on your world/devices.

To run -

`$ terraform init`

`$ terraform plan`

`$ terraform apply`

If you wish to delete infrastructures after playing: 
`$ terraform destroy`
