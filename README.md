# IACs with Terraform
 Testing and learning Terraform Infrastructure As Code with AWS services

This is an incremental process of making things from the beginning.
I am learning and creating them.

#### Making aws infrastructures with Terraform:
* create s3 bucket  (tested)
* python file -> zip -> up to s3 -> create a lambda function

and so on....

The codes are tested by me. But I can not assure that they will run on your world/devices.
